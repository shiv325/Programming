# Introduction to Programming

- Set of Logic along with defined set of rules (syntax)
- Produces well-defined and complete outcome which further solves real-world problems

# Programming Language

- Medium to communicate with various parts of computer
- Example => Python, Java, C, C++, Binary Code, Assembly Language etc.

# Types of Programming Language

1. Low-Level Language
2. High-Level Language

# Difference between Low-Level Language and High-Level Language

|                       Low-Level Language                             |                                 High-Level Language                                |

|         Computer operates internally via these languages             |               Most of the work and code is written in these languages              |
|             Defines internal functioning of computer                 | Computer converts high-level code into low-level code and then program is executed | 
|  Most of the details of implementation are hidden from outer world   |               Minute details are coded by programmers in outer world               |
| Examples => Binary Codes, Assembly Language, Compiler Language, etc. |                       Examples => Python, C, C++, Java, etc.                       |

# Programming Paradigm

- Fundamental Approach to Computer Programming
- Provides different ways to conceptulaize and structure the tasks performed

Most Common Programming Paradigms are :

1. `Imperative Programming` :

- Focuses on way to perform tasks
- Code is written as sequence of instructions that change the program's state
- Examples: C, Fortran, Assembly language

2. `Procedural Programming` :

- A subtype of imperative programming
- Structures programs into procedures or functions
- Emphasizes a clear sequence of actions and use of variables
- Examples: C, Pascal

3. `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)` :

- Organizes code into objects containing both data and methods
- Promotes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Examples: Java, C++, Python, Ruby

4. `Functional Programming` :

- Emphasizes the use of functions
- Avoids changing state or mutable data
- Functions are first-class citizens and can be passed as arguments or returned from other functions
- Examples: Haskell, Lisp, Scala, Erlang

5. `Declarative Programming` :

- Focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how to achieve it
- Includes subparadigms like logic programming and functional programming
- Examples: SQL (for databases), HTML (for web layout), Prolog

6. `Logic Programming` :

- A type of declarative programming
- Uses facts, rules, and queries to solve problems
- Examples: Prolog, Datalog

7. `Event-Driven Programming` :

- Flow of program is determined by events like user actions, sensor outputs, or message passing
- Common in graphical user interfaces and real-time systems
- Examples: JavaScript (in web browsers), ActionScript

8. `Concurrent Programming` :

- Deals with multiple computations happening simultaneously
- Focuses on managing shared resources and synchronization
- Examples: Java (with threads), Go, Erlang

9. `Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)` :

- Separates cross-cutting concerns from main program logic
- Useful for logging, security, and transaction management
- Examples: AspectJ (an extension of Java)

10. `Scripting Paradigm` :

- Focuses on automating repetitive tasks and manipulating other software components
- Often interpreted rather than compiled
- Examples: Python, Perl, Bash
